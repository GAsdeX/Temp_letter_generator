I've recently created a bunch of scrappers including the required functionality:\n- scrapping yellowpages;\n- finding contact page(s) on company website(s);\n- finding emails.\nFinding company twitter and looking for email there also can be helpful.\nPossible solutions are Chrome extension or PHP script.\n\nI can start immediately and prove the concept within a day.\nThe entire development will take 3 days for programming and 3-5 days for testing.\nMy skype: promios\n\nBest regards,\nRinat"
